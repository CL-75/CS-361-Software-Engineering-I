LIFE GENERATOR by Casey Levy

This web app can return a list of Amazon's most popular toys based on a toy category chosen by the user. The user will select a category from a dropdown box, then enter a number of results they would like displayed. The program will then output the desired amount of results based on category selection, as well as sorted by rating. 

Used in conjunction with another person's "Population Generator" app, this program can also output results of a state, and its population from a particular year, based on user input. Once the user selects a category and number of results, the first state in order whose first letter matches the first letter of that category is displayed, as well as the first year whose LAST number matches the FIRST number of the desired number of results is displayed. 

EXAMPLE: The user chooses the "Hobbies" category and requests "72" results to be displayed. This will communicate with the Population Generator and it will return the state "Hawaii" and its population from the year "2007". Hobbies = Hawaii and 72 = 2007.
